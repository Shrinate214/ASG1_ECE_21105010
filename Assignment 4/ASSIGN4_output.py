Let A be the initial rod where the discs are currently present
Let B is the extra or mid rod
And C be the final rod where the discs are supposed to reach
Steps Required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 discs :
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Number of steps will be: 7
Enter number of rows to be printed in the pascal triangle problem:5
The Pascal's Triangle using iteration is:
    1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
The Pascal's Triangle using recusion is:
    1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
Enter the first integer:34
Enter the second integer:8
Remainder is: 2
Quotient is: 4
Checking whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
It returns true which means it is callable
Checking whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(quotient and remainder) are non-zero
On Adding (4,5,6) to the result of division and filtering out values greater than 4:
The new list formed is: (2, 4, 4, 5, 6)
Values greater than 4 are: [5, 6]
Converting the output from list 1into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {5, 6}
Making the output set of previous part immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({5, 6})
Evaluating the maximum value from the set and finding out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 6
The hash value of set on considering it to be an integer is: 6
The hash value of set on considering it as a string is: -4087217822581035354
